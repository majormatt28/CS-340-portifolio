- The way I write programs that are maintainable, adaptable, and readable is by having my code have understandable variables and clean code practice. What I mean by clean code practice is breaking down each of the problmes into there own functions. This helped me with being able to remember what I did previously on my project as well as where I left off. 

- The way I apporach problems I tend to break them down and understand each component before moving on to a new one. I want to make sure that the solution I give covers each issue the problem goes over. The way i approached this project is seeing what Grazioso wanted and then implementing them first since most of the other logic needed to find specific animals was already established.
